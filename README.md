# Singlet_Oxygen
This repository contains the scripts required to analyze singlet oxygen experimental data. You will need to run these scripts on the UBC Syzygy server (https://ubc.syzygy.ca/) and sign in using your CWL. 

The code is not universal and will not work for every variety of experiment you might run, so expect to have to alter code in places.
