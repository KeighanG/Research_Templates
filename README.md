# Singlet_Oxygen, Triplet_States & Actinometry
This repository contains: 
  - The scripts required to analyze singlet oxygen experimental data using a chemical probe of furfuryl alcohol and a reference sensitizer of perinapthenone.
  - The scripts required to analyze "double probe" experiments for simultaneous triplet state and singlet oxygen quantification
  - The scripts required to do chemical actinometry calculations and conversion to sunlight irradiance time for atmospheric relevance.

You will need to run these scripts on a system compatable with Jupyter notebooks (ipynb file extension). I recommend the UBC Syzygy server (https://ubc.syzygy.ca/) where every student (and I assume staff) can sign in using their CWL. 

To download individual files, click on the file and press the download button in the top right corner of the file preview.

There are also csv files which should be downloaded.

Once you have downloaded the files, upload them to your jupyterhub (you can simply drag and drop) and follow the instructions in the individual template

The code is not universal and will not work for every variety of experiment you might run, so expect to have to alter code in places. 

To download all items contained in this repository, click the green "code" button and click "download ZIP". Then upload my code files to your jupyterhub. 

Questions about the code in this repository can be sent to Keighan Gemmell (keighan@chem.ubc.ca)
